# min-vm
An experimental VM hand-crafted with love ‚ù§

# Intro

(Please, excuse my english, it isn't my first language.)

I had heard before about some systems that use their own VMs, like the Java enviroment or the Python interpreter, but I hadn't really understood how or why that was, nor did I really care. Then I found some examples of individuals who built their own physical CPUs or wrote their own custom VMs and then I got interested in the subject. It was as if, now that I knew a mere mortal like me could do something of that magnitude, then I ***should*** too.
