# Welcome to min-vm
An experimental VM hand-crafted with love. ‚ù§

## Intro üåü

> Please excuse my english, it isn't my first language. Thank you. üôè

**min-vm** represents my own attempt üí™ at understanding the subject of virtual machines. 

I had heard about systems that function on their own VMs (like Java ‚òï or Python üêç, and I think V8 or Node ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk), but I hadn't really understood how or why that was, nor did I really care. But then I found about people who wrote their own **OS** or **kernel**, some who wrote their own **VM** or **assembler**, and some even built their own **physical CPUs on breadboards** (what‚Åâ). Now, ***that*** got me interested. It was as if, now that I knew a mere mortal like me could do something like that with such little requirements, then I ***should*** do it too.

So, welcome to The Internet, have a look around. üé∂üòé

## The VM ‚öô

[üöß Some description]

## The compiler ‚úç

Technically an assembler, not a compiler, but it sounds *way cooler*. üòé 

### The instruction set üß¨

By convention, instruction names are at least 2 and not more than 4 characters long.

The following is a list of the instructions the assembler is (or will be) able to interpret.

| Opcode   | Instruction Name                                       | Description                                                 |
